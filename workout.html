<h1 class=title>HOW I LOST 10KG IN 2MONTHS <br> WITHOUT WORKING OUT AT ALL</h1>
<h2 class=more>YES, IT'S POSSIBLE, AND TO BE HONEST IT'S NOT HARD AT ALL</h2>

<p class=author>BY: Michalina Debska</p>

<section class=p1>Quarantine mmm... what a beautiful time, wasn't it? I think most of us, suddenly thrown out of our routines, gained some weight but when I say I always go all in- I ALWAYS GO ALL IN. Sooo, well, after those 2 months I became greater by like 10kg. It wasn't just the lockdown itself though. At that time I was living in the US and we all know how it is there. You just cannot escape all the fast food and sugars-I really tried but when I tried ChickFil-A (my new fav fast food restaurant) for the first time I totally lost it.

<section class=p2>OK, so here we are. Unmotivated, fat (how my friends and family would call me) and not feeling the best in my own body. When Summer came, I obviously had fun but I also noticed that I started holding myself back from certain activities. I wouldn't want to go swimming in the ocean with my friends, I wouldn't want to eat too much at the parties so I wouldn't be called out, I even stopped flirting with guys because I didn't feel worthy and beautiful enough for them. Sounds depressing, doesnt it...</section>

<p class=p3>It was one of the worst times in my life and I knew I had to do something about it. I started doing those dance workouts (the One Direction one!) but I wasn't seeing any results and it only made me feel worse. I felt so helpless until my friend told me about that app. The app that (I can say that with 100% confidence) changed my life.</p>
<p class=p4>I downloaded the Fitatu app, kind of doubting that only changing my diet-what or how much I eat, would do anything for me.  </p>
<p class=p5>BUT LET ME TELL YOU- it completely changed the game! I put all my goals in there and it not only told me how many calories a day and what should I eat, but also when would I accomplish my goal. I felt sooo motivated when I saw I was only 3 months away from my perfect weight and started implementing the changes right away.</p>

<p class=p6>After only 2 months I saw absolutely incredible results (just take a look at the pics). The best thing was that I didn’t even have to give up any sweets (I could neverrrr) - just had to control the calories input and remember to log all my meals into the app. Because of that I stopped snacking (which is the absolute killer if you want to lose weight)  in between the meals- it was just too annoying to log 5 eaten chips yk. After a while I didn’t need the app anymore. My body adjusted and it knew by itself how much calories it needed.</p>
<p class=p7>It was so easy and honestly- UNEXPECTED. I feel like not enough people talk about it. It’s always working out regularly but as You can see - that’s not the case.</p>
<p class=p8>I’m sure You got inspired and are ready to get started, soooooo- what are You waiting for? You saw my results. Now it’s Your turn!</p>
